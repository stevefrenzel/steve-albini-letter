      <p>Kurt, Dave and Chris:</p>
      <p>
        First let me apologize for taking a couple of days to put this outline
        together. When I spoke to Kurt I was in the middle of making a Fugazi
        album, but I thought I would have a day or so between records to sort
        everything out. My schedule changed unexpectedly, and this is the first
        moment I've had to go through it all. Apology Apology.
      </p>
      <p>
        I think the very best thing you could do at this point is exactly what
        you are talking about doing : bang a record out in a couple of days,
        with high quality but minimal "production" and no interference from the
        front office bulletheads. If that is indeed what you want to do, I would
        love to be involved.
      </p>
      <p>
        If, instead, you might find yourselves in the position of being
        temporarily indulged by the record company, only to have them yank the
        chain at some point (hassling you to rework songs/sequences/production,
        calling-in hired guns to "sweeten" your record, turning the whole thing
        over to some remix jockey, whatever...) then you're in for a bummer and
        I want no part of it.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm only interested in working on records that legitimately reflect the
        band's own perception of their music and existance. If you will commit
        yourselves to that as a tenet of the recording methodology, then I will
        bust my ass for you. I'11 work circles around you. I'll rap your head in
        with a ratchet...
      </p>
      <p>
        I have worked on hundreds of records (some great, some good, some
        horrible, a lot in the courtyard), and I have seen a direct correlation
        between the quality of the end result and the mood of the band
        throughout the process. If the record takes a long time, and everyone
        gets bummed and scrutinizes every step, then the recordings bear little
        resemblance to the live band, and the end result is seldom flattering.
        Making punk rock records is definitely a case where more "work" does not
        imply a better end result. Clearly you have learned this yourselves and
        appreciate the logic.
      </p>
      <p>About my recording methodology and philosophy:</p>
      <p>
        #1: Most contemporary engineers and producers see a record as a
        "project," and the band as only one element of the project. Further,
        they consider the recordings to be a controlled layering of specific
        sounds, each of which is under complete control from the moment the note
        is conceived through the final mix. If the band gets pushed around in
        the process of making a record, so be it; as long as the "project" meets
        with the approval of the fellow in control.
      </p>
      <p>My approach is exactly the opposite.</p>
      <p>
        I consider the band the most important thing, as the creative entity
        that spanned both the band's personality and style and as the social
        entity that exists 24 hours out of each day. I do not consider it my
        place to tell you what to do or how to play. I'm quite willing to let my
        opinions be heard (if I think the band is making beautiful progress or a
        heaving mistake, I consider it part of my job to tell them) but if the
        band decides to pursue something, I'll see that it gets done.
      </p>
      <p>
        I like to leave room for accidents and chaos. Making a seamless record,
        where every note and syllable is in place and every bass drum beat is
        identical, is no trick. Any idiot with the patience and the budget to
        allow such foolishness can do it. I prefer to work on records that
        aspire to greater things, like originality, personality and enthusiasm.
        If every element of the music and dynamics of a band is controlled by
        click tracks, computers, automated mixes, gates, samplers and
        sequencers, then the record may not be incompetent, but it certainly
        won't be exceptional. It will also bear very little relationship to the
        live band, which is what all this hooey is supposed to be about.
      </p>
      <p>
        #2: I do not consider recording and mixing to be unrelated tasks which
        can be performed by specialists with no continuous involvement. 99
        percent of the sound of a record should be established while the basic
        take is recorded. Your experiences are specific to your records; but in
        my experience, remixing has never solved any problems that actually
        existed, only imaginary ones. I do not like remixing other engineer's
        recordings, and I do not like recording things for somebody else to
        remix. I have never been satisfied with either version of that
        methodology. Remixing is for talentless pussies who don't know how to
        tune a drum or point a microphone.
      </p>
      <p>
        #3: I do not have a fixed gospel of stock sounds and recording
        techniques that I apply blindly to every band in every situation. You
        are a different band from any other band and deserve at least the
        respect of having your own tastes and concerns addressed. For example, I
        love the sound of a boomy drum kit (say a Gretsch or Camco) wide open in
        a big room, especially with a Bonhanny double-headed bass drum and a
        really painful snare drum. I also love the puke-inducing low end that
        comes off an old Fender Bassman or Ampeg guitar amp and the totally
        blown sound of an SVT with broken-in tubes. I also know that those
        sounds are inappropriate for some songs, and trying to force them is a
        waste of time. Predicating the recordings on my tastes is as stupid as
        designing a car around the upholstery. You guys need to decide and then
        articulate to me what you want to sound like so we don't come at the
        record from different directions.
      </p>
      <p>
        #4: where we record the record is not as important as how it is
        recorded. If you have a studio you'd like to use, no hag. Otherwise, I
        can make suggestions. I have a nice 24-track studio in my house (Fugazi
        were just there, you can ask them how they rate it), and I'm familiar
        with most of the studios in the Midwest, the East coast and a dozen or
        so in the UK.
      </p>
      <p>
        I would ba a little concerned about having you at me house for the
        duration of the whole recording and mixing process (if only because
        you're celebrities, and I wouldn't want word getting out in the
        neighborhood and you guys having to put up with a lot of fan-style
        bullshit); it would be a fine place to mix the record though, and you
        can't beat the vittles.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you want to leave the details of studio selection, lodging, etc. up
        to me, I'm quite happy to sort all that stuff out. If you guys went to
        sort it out, just lay down the law.
      </p>
      <p>
        My first choice for an outside recording studio would be a place called
        Pachyderm in Cannon Falls, Minnesota. It's a great facility with
        outstanding acoustics and a totally comfy architect's wet-dream mansion
        where the band lives during the recordings. This makes everything more
        efficient. Since everybody is there, things get done and decisions get
        made a lot faster than if people are out and about in a city someplace.
        There's also all the posh shit like a sauna and swimming pool and
        fireplaces and trout stream and 50 acres and like that. I've made a
        bunch of records there and I've always enjoyed the place. It's also
        quite inexpensive, considering how great a facility it is.
      </p>
      <p>
        The only bummer about Pachyderm is that the owners and manager are not
        technicians, and they don't have a tech on call. I've worked there
        enough that I can fix just about anything that can go wrong, short of a
        serious electronic collapse, but I've got a guy that I work with a lot
        (Bob Weston) who's real good with electronics (circuit design, trouble
        shooting and building shit on the spot), so if we choose to do it there,
        he'll probably come along in my payroll, since he'd be cheap insurance
        if a power supply blows up or a serious failure occurs in the dead of
        winter 50 miles from the closest tech. He's a recording engineer also,
        so he can be doing some of the more mundane stuff (cataloging tapes,
        packing stuff up, fetching supplies) while we're chopping away at the
        record proper.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some day I'm going to talk the Jesus Lizard into going up there and
        we'll have us a real time. Oh yeah, and it's the same Neve console the
        AC/DC album Back in Black was recorded and mixed on, so you know its
        just got to have the rock.
      </p>
      <p>
        #5: Dough. I explained this to Kurt but I thought I'd better reiterate
        it here. I do not want and will not take a royalty on any record I
        record. No points. Period. I think paying a royalty to a producer or
        engineer is ethically indefensible. The band writes the songs. The band
        play the music. It's the band's fans who buy the records. The band is
        responsible for whether it's a great record or a horrible record.
        Royalties belong to the band.
      </p>
      <p>
        I would like to be paid like a plumber: I do the job and you pay me what
        it's worth. The record company will expect me to ask for a point or a
        point and a half. If we assume three million sales, that works out to
        400,000 dollars or so. There's no fucking way I would ever take that
        much money. I wouldn't be able to sleep.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have to be comfortable with the amount of money you pay me, but it's
        your money, and I insist that you be comfortable with it as well. Kurt
        suggested paying me a chunk which I would consider full payment, and
        then if you really thought I deserved more, paying me another chunk
        after you'd had a chance to live with the album for a while. That would
        be fine, but probably more organizational trouble than it's worth.
      </p>
      <p>
        Whatever. I trust you guys to be fair to me and I know you must be
        familiar with what a regular industry goon would want. I will let you
        make the final decision about what I'm going to be paid. How much you
        choose to pay me will not affect my enthusiasm for the record.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some people in my position would expect an increase in business after
        being associated with your band. I, however, already have more work than
        I can handle, and frankly, the kind of people such superficialities will
        attract are not people I want to work with. Please don't consider that
        an issue.
      </p>
      <p>That's it.</p>
      <p>Please call me to go over any of this if it's unclear.</p>
